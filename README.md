Re: Skin System Updates

"What if you were to program a sort of... skin database. Like the iTunes App Store, where people could submit their skins and download them, all from the program. It just randomly came to me..."

This post made me think... Why shouldn't there be a skin database? Well, now there is! It has all the working skins (A lot aren't working due to megaupload.com being shutdown and Mediafire keys expiring), referencing the list by Kirk (http://pmuniverse.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=39&t=5557). Currently, there are 56 available skins, but more can be added if new ones are made or the broken link ones are reuploaded. If I missed yours, PM me and I'll add it! Someday, I hope there will be so many that the database will be filled! (and I'll just make another account)
